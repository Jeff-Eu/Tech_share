* [Tree-Think] - Filter of ListView
	v When onNotifyChanged is called, what function is called ? What overridden api should I implement ? 
	o Use a view-model List (called vList) passing to my adapter, the vList will be filtered from the dataList.
		o [Methods]
			o [1] One way binding from dataList to vList. When new data is added from dataList, vList is also added if needed.
				o vList must keep persistent in memory
				x Study the two way binding in the C#
			o [2] No binding. Only when needing to show ListView, the vList will be reset and re-created from dataList (selected!)
	* [Conclude] Use method 2
		* Add a boolean variable to check for update
