# L5_App Architecture (UI Layer)

* 5. What is Architecture
    * 每一次 Architecture Pattern 都有它的優缺點，MVVM也是。
    - [Code Sample - Android Architecture Blueprints](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples)
        - 同一個ap用各種Architecture Pattern來實作，值得研究：Blueprints v1 had a collection of samples that are not maintained anymore, but can still be useful. [See all project branches](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/branches).

* 6. Our App Architecture
    * UI-Controller & ViewModel & LiveData
        * UI controller is the word that I'm using to describe what activities and fragments are.
        * UI controller is responsible for any user interface related tasks

* 7. ViewModel
    * 為了解決像rotate會需要Fragment跟Activity去重建的狀況，會利用 onSaveInstanceState寫在Fragment中，如果裡面做很多複雜的事，這種寫法會變很複雜，這時候可以把這些邏輯寫進ViewModel
    * The ViewModel survives configuration changes.
    * Unlike the onSaveInstanceState bundle, the ViewModel has no restrictions on size!
